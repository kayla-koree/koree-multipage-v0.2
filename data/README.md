# Koree learning-card data

`cards.json` is the content source for Play/Discover's learning-card & question-bank features. Each entry:

| field | required | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | unique slug, e.g. `gwaenchanha-01` |
| `korean` | yes | the Korean word/expression |
| `romanization` | no | revised romanization |
| `meaning` | yes | plain-English meaning/explanation |
| `nuance` | no | context notes — when it lands differently than the dictionary meaning |
| `example_ko` | no | example sentence in Korean |
| `example_en` | no | translation of the example |
| `source` | no | e.g. "K-drama", "K-pop", "slang" |
| `category` | no | tag used for filtering (nuance, slang, idiom, grammar, ...) |
| `difficulty` | no | `beginner` / `intermediate` / `advanced` |
| `audio_text` | no | text passed to the TTS player (`data-audio` in script.js); defaults to `korean` if omitted |

To add cards: paste raw data (list, table, screenshots-as-text, spreadsheet export) to Claude — the koree-web-builder agent normalizes it into this schema and appends to `cards.json`, then commits/pushes.
